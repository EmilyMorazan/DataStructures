As automation, AI, and digital transformation reshape the job market, programming and computational thinking are becoming essential skills for nearly every profession. CodeReady helps students build these future-ready skills through an interactive, adaptive web platform that teaches real-world programming concepts and problem-solving abilities.

Many Computer Science students struggle to translate academic programming knowledge into real-world, job-ready skills. Our project bridges that gap by providing an interactive web platform that teaches programming through hands-on projects, AI-powered feedback, and real-world skill pathways — preparing learners for the rapidly evolving tech careers of tomorrow.

1) Data Structures Lab (learn → apply → ship)
Visual intros, interactive animations, and code exercises for arrays, linked lists, stacks/queues, hash maps, trees/tries, heaps, graphs, BFS/DFS, Dijkstra, union-find.

2) Programming Languages Review Game (“Index Quest”)
Indexed by language (Python, Java, C++, JS) and topic (syntax, types, OOP, std lib, memory model, concurrency).
Micro-challenges: predict output, spot the bug, fill the gap, tiny refactor.
Outputs a Skills Matrix and badges; exportable for LinkedIn/GitHub profile.

3) Concept Review (spaced & scenario-based)
Spaced repetition for core concepts and patterns.
Short scenario cards that force tradeoffs (pick the right DS, defend complexity).
Weekly mini-capstones (e.g., rate limiter, URL shortener, log deduper) with small repos and design notes.
